            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Hi there! I'm Myra, an accomplished industrial psychologist with over 12 years of experience in the field. I am truly passionate about unlocking 
                        the full potential of individuals and organizations. My journey began with a Master's degree in Industrial-Organisational Psychology from the 
                        prestigious University of KwaZulu-Natal.Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of organizations, partnering 
                        with them to revolutionize their workplace practices and culture.My expertise lies in leadership development, employee engagement, and talent management. By creating tailored strategies and implementing innovative solutions, 
                        I have witnessed teams flourish, productivity soar, and businesses thrive.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>What sets me apart is my insatiable thirst for knowledge and adventure. When I'm not immersed in enhancing workplace dynamics, you'll find me exploring new corners of the world. 
                        Travelling fuels my creativity and provides a fresh lens through which I approach challenges. Additionally, I find immense joy in spending quality time with my loved ones and creating a warm, inviting home environment that reflects my personality.
                        An analytical and inquisitive mind has always been my driving force. I thrive on delving into complex problems, uncovering insights, and finding practical solutions. 
                        These skills, coupled with my strong attention to detail, logical thinking, and effective communication, make me a well-rounded professional, capable of thriving in 
                        any setting.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>In addition to my accomplishments in the field of industrial psychology, I am currently pursuing a degree in software engineering. My fascination with technology has 
                        been a constant in my life, and I have always been captivated by the possibilities it offers for innovation and problem-solving. By studying software engineering, 
                        I am further expanding my skill set and deepening my understanding of the digital realm. Not only does this allow me to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape, 
                        but it also aligns with my desire to diversify my income streams. I believe that by gaining expertise in software engineering, I can unlock new opportunities and create 
                        additional sources of revenue, ultimately providing me with greater financial stability and the freedom to explore diverse professional avenues.</p>
